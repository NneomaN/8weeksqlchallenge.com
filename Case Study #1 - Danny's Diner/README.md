*My attempt at solving the Danny's Diner case study of the 8 weeks SQL challenge using T-SQL to query data hosted on an MS SQL Server*.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, 
especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. 
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.  
Additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
